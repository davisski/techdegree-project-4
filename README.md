OO JavaScript Word guessing game

In this project I created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter". I used Object-oriented JavaScript to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or laptop keyboard.

For this project I created two JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods to them.

# Updated default CSS styles

1. Added keyframes shake and created shake class - to help, make better UX(user experience - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) with user, to show which one key was wrong.

2. Added z-index property to HTML object with id of 'overlay' - to make sure overlay overlaps over all elements.
