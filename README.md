OO JavaScript Word guessing game

In this project I'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter". I'll use Object-oriented JavaScript to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

For this project I'll create two JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods to them.
